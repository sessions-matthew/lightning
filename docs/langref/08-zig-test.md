## Zig Test

Code written within one or more `test` declarations can be used to ensure behavior meets expectations:

**`testing_introduction.zig`**
```zig
const std = @import("std");

test "expect addOne adds one to 41" {

    // The Standard Library contains useful functions to help create tests.
    // `expect` is a function that verifies its argument is true.
    // It will return an error if its argument is false to indicate a failure.
    // `try` is used to return an error to the test runner to notify it that the test failed.
    try std.testing.expect(addOne(41) == 42);

    // However, in most cases it is more convenient to use a more specific function like `expectEqual`.
    // This gives you much clearer and more helpful error messages when a test fails.
    try std.testing.expectEqual(42, addOne(41));
}

test addOne {
    // A test name can also be written using an identifier.
    // This is a doctest, and serves as documentation for `addOne`.
    try std.testing.expectEqual(42, addOne(41));
}

/// The function `addOne` adds one to the number given as its argument.
fn addOne(number: i32) i32 {
    return number + 1;
}
```

```sh
$ zig test testing_introduction.zig
1/2 testing_introduction.test.expect addOne adds one to 41...OK
2/2 testing_introduction.decltest.addOne...OK
All 2 tests passed.
```

The `testing_introduction.zig` code sample tests the [function](#Functions)
`addOne` to ensure that it returns `42` given the input
`41`. From this test's perspective, the `addOne` function is
said to be *code under test*.

`zig test` is a tool that creates and runs a test build. By default, it builds and runs an
executable program using the *default test runner* provided by the [Zig Standard Library](#Zig-Standard-Library)
as its main entry point. During the build, `test` declarations found while
[resolving](#File-and-Declaration-Discovery) the given Zig source file are included for the default test runner
to run and report on.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation discusses the features of the default test runner as provided by the Zig Standard Library.
> Its source code is located in `lib/compiler/test_runner.zig`.

The shell output shown above displays two lines after the `zig test` command. These lines are
printed to standard error by the default test runner:

- **`1/2 testing_introduction.test.expect addOne adds one to 41...`**: Lines like this indicate which test, out of the total number of tests, is being run. In this case, `1/2` indicates that the first test, out of a total of two tests, is being run. Note that, when the test runner program's standard error is output to the terminal, these lines are cleared when a test succeeds.
- **`2/2 testing_introduction.decltest.addOne...`**: When the test name is an identifier, the default test runner uses the text decltest instead of test.
- **`All 2 tests passed.`**: This line indicates the total number of tests that have passed.

<a id="Test-Declarations"></a>
### Test Declarations

Test declarations contain the [keyword](#Keyword-Reference) `test`, followed by an
optional name written as a [string literal](#String-Literals-and-Unicode-Code-Point-Literals) or an
[identifier](#Identifiers), followed by a [block](#Blocks) containing any valid Zig code that
is allowed in a [function](#Functions).

Non-named test blocks always run during test builds and are exempt from
[Skip Tests](#Skip-Tests).

Test declarations are similar to [Functions](#Functions): they have a return type and a block of code. The implicit
return type of `test` is the [Error Union Type](#Error-Union-Type) `anyerror!void`,
and it cannot be changed. When a Zig source file is not built using the `zig test` tool, the test
declarations are omitted from the build.

Test declarations can be written in the same file, where code under test is written, or in a separate Zig source file.
Since test declarations are top-level declarations, they are order-independent and can
be written before or after the code under test.

- [Grammar](#Grammar)

<a id="Doctests"></a>
#### Doctests

Test declarations named using an identifier are *doctests*. The identifier must refer to another declaration in
scope. A doctest, like a [doc comment](#Doc-Comments), serves as documentation for the associated declaration, and
will appear in the generated documentation for the declaration.

An effective doctest should be self-contained and focused on the declaration being tested, answering questions a new
user might have about its interface or intended usage, while avoiding unnecessary or confusing details. A doctest is not
a substitute for a doc comment, but rather a supplement and companion providing a testable, code-driven example, verified
by `zig test`.

<a id="Test-Failure"></a>
### Test Failure

The default test runner checks for an [error](#Errors) returned from a test.
When a test returns an error, the test is considered a failure and its [error return trace](#Error-Return-Traces)
is output to standard error. The total number of failures will be reported after all tests have run.

**`testing_failure.zig`**
```zig
const std = @import("std");

test "expect this to fail" {
    try std.testing.expect(false);
}

test "expect this to succeed" {
    try std.testing.expect(true);
}
```

```sh
$ zig test testing_failure.zig
1/2 testing_failure.test.expect this to fail...FAIL (TestUnexpectedResult)
/private/tmp/s-gZHkm6ql/zig-20261003-6388-n6l20x/zig-0.17.0/lib/std/testing.zig:584:14: 0x102e2b3d7 in expect (test)
    if (!ok) return error.TestUnexpectedResult;
             ^

    try std.testing.expect(false);
    ^
2/2 testing_failure.test.expect this to succeed...OK
1 passed; 0 skipped; 1 failed.
error: the following test command failed with exit code 1:

```

<a id="Skip-Tests"></a>
### Skip Tests

One way to skip tests is to filter them out by using the `zig test` command line parameter
`--test-filter [text]`. This makes the test build only include tests whose name contains the
supplied filter text. Note that non-named tests are run even when using the `--test-filter [text]`
command line parameter.

To programmatically skip a test, make a `test` return the error
`error.SkipZigTest` and the default test runner will consider the test as being skipped.
The total number of skipped tests will be reported after all tests have run.

**`testing_skip.zig`**
```zig
test "this will be skipped" {
    return error.SkipZigTest;
}
```

```sh
$ zig test testing_skip.zig
1/1 testing_skip.test.this will be skipped...SKIP
0 passed; 1 skipped; 0 failed.
```

<a id="Report-Memory-Leaks"></a>
### Report Memory Leaks

When code allocates [Memory](#Memory) using the [Zig Standard Library](#Zig-Standard-Library)'s testing allocator,
`std.testing.allocator`, the default test runner will report any leaks that are
found from using the testing allocator:

**`testing_detect_leak.zig`**
```zig
const std = @import("std");

test "detect leak" {
    const gpa = std.testing.allocator;
    var list: std.ArrayList(u21) = .empty;
    // missing `defer list.deinit(gpa);`
    try list.append(gpa, '☔');

    try std.testing.expectEqual(1, list.items.len);
}
```

```sh
$ zig test testing_detect_leak.zig
1/1 testing_detect_leak.test.detect leak...OK
[SafeAllocator] (err): leaked [addr: 1051fc010, len: 132 (0x84) align: 4] allocated at:

                const new_memory = try gpa.alignedAlloc(T, alignment, new_capacity);

            return self.ensureTotalCapacityPrecise(gpa, growCapacity(new_capacity));
                                                  ^

### Detecting Test Build

Use the [compile variable](#Compile-Variables) `@import("builtin").is_test`
to detect a test build:

**`testing_detect_test.zig`**
```zig
const std = @import("std");
const builtin = @import("builtin");
const expect = std.testing.expect;

test "builtin.is_test" {
    try expect(isATest());
}

fn isATest() bool {
    return builtin.is_test;
}
```

```sh
$ zig test testing_detect_test.zig
1/1 testing_detect_test.test.builtin.is_test...OK
All 1 tests passed.
```

<a id="Test-Output-and-Logging"></a>
### Test Output and Logging

The default test runner and the Zig Standard Library's testing namespace output messages to standard error.

<a id="The-Testing-Namespace"></a>
### The Testing Namespace

The Zig Standard Library's `testing` namespace contains useful functions to help
you create tests. In addition to the `expect` function, this document uses a couple of more functions
as exemplified here:

**`testing_namespace.zig`**
```zig
const std = @import("std");

test "expectEqual demo" {
    const expected: i32 = 42;
    const actual = 42;

    // The first argument to `expectEqual` is the known, expected, result.
    // The second argument is the result of some expression.
    // The actual's type is casted to the type of expected.
    try std.testing.expectEqual(expected, actual);
}

test "expectError demo" {
    const expected_error = error.DemoError;
    const actual_error_union: anyerror!void = error.DemoError;

    // `expectError` will fail when the actual error is different than
    // the expected error.
    try std.testing.expectError(expected_error, actual_error_union);
}
```

```sh
$ zig test testing_namespace.zig
1/2 testing_namespace.test.expectEqual demo...OK
2/2 testing_namespace.test.expectError demo...OK
All 2 tests passed.
```

The Zig Standard Library also contains functions to compare [Slices](#Slices), strings, and more. See the rest of the
`std.testing` namespace in the [Zig Standard Library](#Zig-Standard-Library) for more available functions.

<a id="Test-Tool-Documentation"></a>
### Test Tool Documentation

`zig test` has a few command line parameters which affect the compilation.
See `zig test --help` for a full list.
